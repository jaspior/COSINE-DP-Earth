<h2>Abstract</h2>
          
<p>The existence of dark matter is proven by gravitational evidence, and various theoretical models propose particles with properties attributed to it. There is a
global effort to detect dark matter, and the DAMA/LIBRA experiment, which uses NaI(Tl) crystals, has been presenting signals consistent with the expected annual
modulation of WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle) event rates since the 1990s. No other experiment has observed this signal so far, which has motivated
the creation of several experiments, including COSINE-100. This experiment is a joint effort of the KIMS and DM-Ice experiments and uses the same material as
DAMA/LIBRA. Located at the Yangyang Laboratory (Y2L) in South Korea, it has taken data from the beginning of its operation in 2016 until 2023, when the
upgrade and relocation of the detector started. So far, the obtained data neither confirm nor exclude the DAMA/LIBRA results. The lack of success in detecting
WIMPs encourages the search for other particles that could explain dark matter. One of the candidates is dark photons, mediators of a dark sector, with a kinetic
coupling with the standard model photon. According to this theoretical model, the dark photon can be generated from the annihilation or interaction of fermionic
dark matter. This dark matter can accumulate in the center of gravitational wells, such as the center of the Earth. These dark photons decay into a pair of leptons
that can be identified as an excess of signals in the backgrounds present in the experiment, using plastic, liquid, and crystal detectors. Results of the indirect
search for dark matter by detecting pairs of electrons and positrons from the decay of dark photons generated by dark matter accumulated at the center of the
Earth after 1.7 years of data acquisition from the COSINE-100 experiment will be presented, as well as how these results compare with those of other experiments.
