<h2>Abstract</h2>
          
<p>The existence of dark matter is proven by gravitational evidence, and various theoretical models propose particles with properties attributed to it. There is a global effort to detect dark matter, and the DAMA/LIBRA experiment, which uses NaI(Tl) crystals, has been presenting signals consistent with the expected annual modulation of WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle) event rates since the 1990s. No other experiment has observed this signal so far, which has motivated the creation of several experiments, including COSINE-100. This experiment is a joint effort of the KIMS and DM-Ice experiments and uses the same material as DAMA/LIBRA. Located at the Yangyang Laboratory (Y2L) in South Korea, it has taken data from the beginning of its operation in 2016 until 2023, when the upgrade and relocation of the detector started. So far, the obtained data neither confirm nor exclude the DAMA/LIBRA results. The lack of success in detecting WIMPs encourages the search for other particles that could explain dark matter. One of the candidates is dark photons, mediators of a dark sector, with a kinetic coupling with the standard model photon. According to this theoretical model, the dark photon can be generated from the annihilation or interaction of fermionic dark matter. This dark matter can accumulate in the center of gravitational wells, such as the center of the Earth. These dark photons decay into a pair of leptons that can be identified as an excess of signals in the backgrounds present in the experiment, using plastic, liquid, and crystal detectors. Results of the indirect search for dark matter by detecting pairs of electrons and positrons from the decay of dark photons generated by dark matter accumulated at the center of the Earth after 1.7 years of data acquisition from the COSINE-100 experiment will be presented, as well as how these results compare with those of other experiments.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>  
Most evidences of the existence of dark matter are based on gravitational interactions and there are several other evidences for its existence [1-5]. It is known that the universe is currently made up of 4% baryonic matter, 23% dark matter and 73% dark energy. The Standard Model (SM) is widely accepted, given its experimental results, however, it is not capable of explaining the existence of dark matter without extensions [6-8]. The main candidates have been the WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) [9] but the lack of success in their detection encourages the search for other particles of dark matter.

    <h2>Candidates</h2>

    <p>
Models that consider a hidden sector [10] also present candidates, which are characterized by not having a direct connection with the Standard Model and by weakly interacting with the visible sector through a "portal": Dark Photons, Axions, Scalar/Higgs  and Sterile Neutrinos:</p>

Esses portais podem ser classificados com relação ao spin da partícula mediadora: vetor (spin 1) \cite{FAYET}, neutrino, (spin 1/2) \cite{Fabbrichesi_Gabrielli_Lanfranchi_2021}, Higgs (escalar) \cite{dakhiggsportal}  e áxion (pseudo-escalar) \cite{pecceyaxion}:

<ul>
    <li>
        Dark Photons [10]: where the portal is a vector and couples to the eletromagnetism from SM \( F_{\mu \nu} \) to the Dark Photon \( F^{\mu \nu } \prime \)  through a kinectic mixing: \( \frac{\epsilon}{2} F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu} \prime \). The Dark Photon is the force mediator of this dark sector ;
    </li>
    <li>
        Axions and ALP (Axion like particles) [18]: where the portal is a pseudo-scalar and couples to a SM fermion \( \Psi \) or SM photon by \( \frac{a}{fa} \left( F_{\mu \nu} \tilde{F}^{\mu \nu} +  \partial_\mu a \overline{\Psi} \gamma^\mu \gamma_5 \Psi \right) \). Usually, Axions are the only members of their dark sector
    </li>
    <li> Scalr/Dark Higgs [19]: The interaction happens between an scalar S and a Higgs boson bt \( (\mu S + \lambda S^2) H^\dagger H \). The S scalar interact with Yukawa-like couplings.
    </li> 
    <li>
    Sterile Neutrinos/Dark Fermions [20]: Where a massive Dark Fermion N interact with a SM Fermion L and Higgs Boson by  \( y_N \overline{L} H N \). This sector may be populated by many fermions or only sterile neutrinos.
    </li>
    
</ul>
     
 \end{itemize}

<p>
  From the portals, all of them other than Dark Photons violetes gauges principles. In a dark sector with an extra U(1) gauge symmetry, the massive gauge boson, called the hidden photon or dark photon A', acts as a mediator of interactions with the standard model. These particles can be detected directly [11], indirectly [12], and by production in colliders [13].

    <h2>COSINE-100</h2>
    
    <p>
    The COSINE-100 collaboration, whose detectors are located in South Korea, operated between October 2016 and  March 2023; It was built to test DAMA/LIBRA experiment, whose results are contested by several experiments, including COSINE-100 itself, which uses the same material [14].

    The experiment consists of 8 high purity NaI(Tl) crystals (106 kg). They are immersed in approximately 2000 L of liquid scintillator. The shielding structure consists of a copper box, lead and 37 plastic scintillators for cosmic ray muons tagging (Fig 1.).

    Lepton signals detected using plastic, liquid and crystal detector arrays can be used to indirectly search for dark photons.

<h2>Dark Photons from the center of the Earth</h2>
    

<p>
  In this model, dark matter can be collected by celestial bodies [15-17] and annihilate itself in the process: \(\chi\bar{\chi} \xrightarrow{} A'A'\). The Dark Photon A’ can decay in a pair o SM leptons. In this model, the lagrangean is given by:
</p>

<div class="math-container">
  $$ L = - \frac{1}{4}F^{\mu \nu}F_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{4}F^{'\mu \nu}F^{'}_{\mu \nu} + \frac{\epsilon^{2}}{2} F^{\mu \nu}F^{'}_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2}m_{A'}^2 A'^{2} $$ 
  $$ + \sum_f \bar{f} (i  \cancel{\partial}  - q_f e \cancel A - m_f )f + \bar{\chi} (i\cancel{\partial} - g_\chi e \cancel{A'} - m_\chi ) \chi $$
</div>

<p>The model can then be described in terms of the variables \( m_\chi \, m_{A\prime} \, \epsilon \,and \, \alpha_\chi = g_\chi^2/4\pi \). The dark fine structure can be fixed with the condition that the dark matter \( \chi \) saturates to the observed dark matter density via freeze out process, so that \( \alpha_\chi = \alpha_\chi^{th} = 0.035(m_\chi / TeV \).</p>

<p> The decay widht of the dark photon in the process \( A\prime \rightarrow f\bar{f} \) is : <p>
<div class="math-container">
  $$ \Gamma(A' \rightarrow f\bar{f}) = \frac{N_c \epsilon^2 q_f^2\alpha(m^2_{A'} + 2m^2_f)}{3m_{A'}}\sqrt{1 - \frac{4m^2_f}{m^2_{A'}}} $$
</div>
<p>And it's branching ratio is:</p>
<div class="math-container">
  $$    B_f' = \frac{\Gamma(A' \rightarrow f'\bar{f'})}{\sum_f \Gamma(A' \rightarrow f\bar{f})} $$
</div>
    
<p>Where \( N_c\) are the color of the fermions (1 for leptons), \( q_f \) the fermion chager.</p>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jaspior/COSINE-DP-Earth/refs/heads/main/imgs/Branching-ratios-for-the-19-dark-photon-decay-channels-included-in-our-analysis-as-a.png" 
         alt="Branching Ratio" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    <p><strong>Fig 2 - Dark Photon Branching Ration [21]. </strong></p>
    </div>

<p> Using natural units, performing the calculations for the process \( \chi \bar{\chi} \rightarrow m_{A\prime} m_{A\prime} \) in the center-of-mass frame (since thermalized dark matter v \( << \) m)  and then then the process \( A\prime \rightarrow l \bar{l}  \) its possible to determine that the dark phton will have Energy \( E = m_\chi \) in the lab frame. It's possible to determine the angle between the leptons too.</p>


    
<p>
  after the dark matter capture and annihilation rate attained equilibrium, it is possible to estimate the dark photon production and decays using:
</p>

<div class="math-container">
  $$ N_{sig} = 2 \Gamma_{ann}\frac{A_{eff}}{4\pi R^2_{Earth}} \left( e^{-R/L} - e^{-(R+D)/L} -  \right)T $$
</div>

<p>
  Where \(\Gamma_{ann}\) is the Dark Matter Annihilation rate:
</p>

<div class="math-container">
  $$ \Gamma_{ann} = \frac{1}{2}C_{cap} tanh^2\left( \frac{\tau_{Earth}}{\tau} \right) $$
</div>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

    <p>
          For the analysis, a expected signal spectrum was simulated using Geant4 Toolkit and the limits were obtained perfoming a bayesian inference using MCMC.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>    COSINE-100 can be used to search for dark photons. As seen in Fig. 4, the limits may exclude new parameter space regions. It's important to note that, while it's probing an excluded region, a different technique is being used, improving our knowledge.</p>

         alt="Paramater space" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
    <p><strong>Fig 4 - Parameter Space for dark photons for many 
experiments. COSINE-100 may reach new regions depending on the understanding of SN 1987 A limits: Chang et al, 2017 SN 1987 A limits are smaller than previous works, allowing COSINE-100 to reach a non-excluded area. </strong></p>
    </div>

    <p>
        Taking more data will improve the sensitivity of the detector and improve the limits in the parameter space.
