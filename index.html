<h2>Abstract</h2>
          
<p>The existence of dark matter is proven by gravitational evidence, and various theoretical models propose particles with properties attributed to it. There is a
global effort to detect dark matter, and the DAMA/LIBRA experiment, which uses NaI(Tl) crystals, has been presenting signals consistent with the expected annual
modulation of WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle) event rates since the 1990s. No other experiment has observed this signal so far, which has motivated
the creation of several experiments, including COSINE-100. This experiment is a joint effort of the KIMS and DM-Ice experiments and uses the same material as
DAMA/LIBRA. Located at the Yangyang Laboratory (Y2L) in South Korea, it has taken data from the beginning of its operation in 2016 until 2023, when the
upgrade and relocation of the detector started. So far, the obtained data neither confirm nor exclude the DAMA/LIBRA results. The lack of success in detecting
WIMPs encourages the search for other particles that could explain dark matter. One of the candidates is dark photons, mediators of a dark sector, with a kinetic
coupling with the standard model photon. According to this theoretical model, the dark photon can be generated from the annihilation or interaction of fermionic
dark matter. This dark matter can accumulate in the center of gravitational wells, such as the center of the Earth. These dark photons decay into a pair of leptons
that can be identified as an excess of signals in the backgrounds present in the experiment, using plastic, liquid, and crystal detectors. Results of the indirect
search for dark matter by detecting pairs of electrons and positrons from the decay of dark photons generated by dark matter accumulated at the center of the
Earth after 1.7 years of data acquisition from the COSINE-100 experiment will be presented, as well as how these results compare with those of other experiments.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>  
There are several evidences for the existence of dark matter [1-5]. These evidences allow us to know that the universe is currently made up of 4\% baryonic matter, 23\% dark matter and 73\% dark energy.
Most evidences of the existence of dark matter are based on gravitational interactions. The Standard Model (SM) is widely accepted, given its experimental results, however, it is not capable of explaining the existence of dark matter without extensions [6 - 8].
The main candidates have been the WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) [9] but the lack of success in their detection encourages the search for other particles of dark matter</p>

    <h2>Candidates</h2>

    <p>
    Models that consider a hidden sector [10] also present candidates, which are characterized by not having a direct connection with the Standard Model and by weakly interacting with the visible sector through a "portal", which can be: Dark Photons, Axions, Scalar/Higgs  and Sterile Neutrinos.
    In a dark sector with an extra U(1) gauge symmetry, the massive gauge boson, called the hidden photon or dark photon A', acts as a mediator of interactions with the standard model.
    These particles can be detected directly [11], indirectly [12], and by production in colliders [13].

    <h2>COSINE-100</h2>
    
    <p>
    The COSINE-100 collaboration, whose detectors are located in South Korea, operated between October 2016 and  March 2023; It was built to test DAMA/LIBRA experiment, whose results are contested by several experiments, including COSINE-100 itself, which uses the same material [14].


    The experiment consists of 8 high purity NaI(Tl) crystals (106 kg). They are immersed in approximately 2000 L of liquid scintillator. The shielding structure consists of a copper box, lead and 37 plastic scintillators for cosmic ray muons tagging (Fig 1.).

    Lepton signals detected using plastic, liquid and crystal detector arrays can be used to indirectly search for dark photons.

<h2>Dark Photons from the center of the Earth</h2>

<p>
  In this model, dark matter can be collected by celestial bodies [17-19] and annihilate itself in the process: $\chi\bar{\chi} \xrightarrow{} A'A'$. The Dark Photon A’ can decay in a pair o SM leptons. In this model, the lagrangean is given by:
</p>

<div class="math-container">
  $$ L = - \frac{1}{4}F^{\mu \nu}F_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{4}F^{'\mu \nu}F^{'}_{\mu \nu} + \frac{\epsilon^{2}}{2} F^{\mu \nu}F^{'}_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2}m_{A'}^2 A'^{2} $$ 
  $$ + \sum_f \bar{f} (i  \cancel{\partial}  - q_f e \cancel A - m_f )f + \bar{\chi} (i\cancel{\partial} - g_\chi e \cancel{A'} - m_\chi ) \chi $$
</div>

<p>
  after the dark matter capture and annihilation rate attained equilibrium, it is possible to estimate the dark photon production and decays using:
</p>

<div class="math-container">
  $$ N_{sig} = 2 \Gamma_{ann}\frac{A_{eff}}{4\pi R^2_{Earth}} \left( e^{-R/L} - e^{-(R+D)/L} -  \right)T $$
</div>

<p>
  Where $\Gamma_{ann}$ is the Dark Matter Annihilation rate:
</p>

<div class="math-container">
  $$ \Gamma_{ann} = \frac{1}{2}C_{cap} tanh^2\left( \frac{\tau_{Earth}}{\tau} \right) $$
</div>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>
    For the analysis, a expected signal spectrum was simulated using Geant4 Toolkit and the limits were obtained perfoming a bayesian inference using MCMC.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
        
    COSINE-100 can be used to search for dark photons. As seen in Fig. 3, the limits may exclude new parameter space regions. It's important to note that, while it's probing an excluded region, It's using a different technique, improving our knowledge. 
    More data acquisition will improve the sensitivity of the detector and improve the limits in the parameter space.
